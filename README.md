# Joystick-Overlay

This AutoHotKey script displays joystick input in a small window for use as an overlay while streaming or recording games.  
It monitors input from 4 axes: roll, pitch, yaw, and thrust.  
Values are shown against a reference grid on a colored background suitable for chroma key compositing.
